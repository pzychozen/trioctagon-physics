# TRIOCTAGON MAGNETISM M2 — JOINT ACCEPTANCE RECORD v0.1

**Date:** 2 October 2026  
**Lead:** GPT  
**Scope:** mathematics only; current `kernel_physics` model; no implementation or physical magnetic-field identification.

## Final disposition

**M2_JOINTLY_ACCEPTED_WITH_STATED_SCOPE**

Claude and Codex have independently reviewed the corrected M2 nonlinear-persistence result and accept the same local mathematical conclusion and sign certificate within the stated domain.

This record closes the M2 mathematical review gate only. It does **not** authorize kernel, UI, application, paper, repository, TORMENT, Historical, database, service, or model-system changes.

M1 remains closed and unchanged at:

`TRIOCTAGON_MAGNETISM_M1_COMMON_EQUATIONS_CANDIDATE_v0.2`

SHA-256:

`a14e5a108dc49c6f0c75950747567132993bd47b2d12ff7ee69d689a52768ef6`

## Accepted M2 parameter model

The accepted local result is for the exact decimal-rational parameters

```text
epsilon = 1/20
g       = 1/5
k       = (1, 1.2208964704604097, 6.35310346037241)
```

and the certified positive real host of the existing current-physics triad map.

## Accepted mathematical statements

1. **Certified positive host.**  
   The relevant unequal-`k` in-phase real host exists uniquely in the certified local box.

2. **Exact quotient compression.**

   \[
   B(\lambda)=(1-9\lambda)V^T M(u)V .
   \]

3. **Simple transversal flip crossing.**  
   If `m1` is the larger eigenvalue of `V^T M(u)V`,

   \[
   \lambda_c=\frac{1+1/m_1}{9}
   =0.3674763946042135365\ldots
   \]

   and

   \[
   \sigma=9m_1
   =3.9006841580673900404\ldots>0 .
   \]

   The second quotient imaginary multiplier remains strictly inside the unit circle at the crossing, and the certified real block is also stable.

4. **Certified positive flip coefficient.**

   The full two-substep quotient map, including the slaved amplitude correction, has

   \[
   c=0.08652484972178753847\ldots
   \]

   with the accepted rigorous enclosure

   \[
   \boxed{0.0865248497217<c<0.0865248497219}.
   \]

   Thus `c>0` is certified for the declared exact-decimal parameter model.

5. **Supercritical local period doubling.**

   With

   \[
   \mu=\lambda-\lambda_c,
   \]

   an `H`-odd center coordinate may be chosen so that

   \[
   a_{n+1}
   =-(1+\sigma\mu)a_n
   +ca_n^3
   +O(a_n^5+|\mu|a_n^3+\mu^2|a_n|).
   \]

   Therefore, for sufficiently small positive `mu`, a locally attracting period-two branch exists in the quotient with

   \[
   a^2=\frac{\sigma}{c}\mu+O(\mu^2).
   \]

6. **Correct two-step cycle multiplier.**

   At the emerging cycle,

   \[
   \boxed{\rho_c(\mu)=1-4\sigma\mu+O(\mu^2)}.
   \]

   The previously stated factor `2` is superseded.  
   The different expression `1+2 sigma mu + O(mu^2)` refers to the second iterate at the still-existing fixed point, not at the new cycle.

7. **The geometry-attached axial observable detects the critical mode.**

   For the M1 observable

   \[
   W=T(\Re\Omega\times\Im\Omega),
   \]

   the critical direction has nonzero first-order projection,

   \[
   W_q=(3.17358673166478867\ldots,\,
        1.94734707082316243\ldots,\,
        0),
   \]

   so locally

   \[
   |W|
   =25.000075367\ldots\sqrt{\lambda-\lambda_c}
   \,[1+O(\lambda-\lambda_c)].
   \]

   This is a dimensionless mathematical observable in the present model, not a value in tesla.

8. **Full complex two-cycle.**

   `H`/conjugation equivariance maps the two quotient-cycle points into one another. The accumulated common phase cancels over two updates, so the local branch lifts to a genuine full complex-state period-two orbit, modulo the neutral family obtained by global common-phase rotation.

   On that branch,

   \[
   W_{n+1}=-W_n,
   \qquad
   \Gamma_{n+1}=-\Gamma_n .
   \]

   The two-step mean of these alternating observables is zero.

## Corrections incorporated

The jointly accepted result includes these corrections to the original Claude M2 report:

- the amplitude substep is **nonlinear**, not real-linear; its common-phase covariance follows because its real state-dependent matrix depends only on intensities;
- the cycle's second-iterate multiplier is `1 - 4 sigma mu + O(mu^2)`, not `1 - 2 sigma mu + O(mu^2)`;
- the interval sign certificate for `c` closes the original G1 gap.

## Limits retained

The M2 result is local.

It does **not** establish:

- a certified numerical neighbourhood radius;
- an explicit positive interval of admissible `mu`;
- a global basin of attraction;
- that the accepted `sqrt(3) f1` / `sqrt(3) f2` entrance endpoints necessarily enter the local neighbourhood;
- a connection from the local branch to the remote `lambda = 0.5` orbit;
- a global persistence threshold;
- equivalent results for other amplitudes, branches, the equal-`k` double crossing, or the ring;
- adoption of X01;
- a physical magnetic field, electric current, helicity, plasma correspondence, or Maxwell dynamics.

The numerical entrance trajectories remain illustrations only. The open entrance-reachability question is retained as **G2**.

## Review evidence

### Claude

Claude accepted the GPT interval/sign certificate after independently attacking:

- exact decimal/rational conversion and outward interval rounding;
- reciprocal, power and square-root interval operations;
- the third-order Jet algebra;
- the exact cubic amplitude expansion;
- the center-manifold coefficient convention;
- the Krawczyk/Sylvester stability logic.

Claude corrected its own multiplier and real-linearity statements and concluded that the local supercritical flip theorem has all required hypotheses certified within the stated scope.

### Codex

Codex independently reviewed the M2 brief, M1 accepted core, GPT certificate, Claude correction addendum, and supplied artifacts.

Codex independently reproduced:

c        = 0.0865248497217875384733534936089481436...
```

and accepted the interval

`0.0865248497217 < c < 0.0865248497219`.

Its independent checks passed 7/7; supplied GPT checks passed 21/21; Claude's certificate-attack checks passed 7/7.

Codex reported no specific objection and accepted the M2 local flip result with the stated scope.

## Source and repository boundary

The current physics repository remained read-only at:

`64ddea159e0e69888926aa21fa281e42f5dd50b4`

No implementation, kernel, test, paper, UI, service, database, production TORMENT, Historical TORMENT, or application change follows from this record.

## Next scientific decision

M2 is complete.

The next research phase is **not automatically G2** and is **not automatically implementation**.

Possible next directions include:

- testing whether proving entrance-to-local-neighbourhood reachability is worth the effort;
- studying how the accepted local alternating `W` mechanism extends or fails on the ring;
- asking what additional mathematical structure would be required before any physical magnetic interpretation becomes defensible;
- or pausing magnetism and consolidating the accepted M1/M2 mathematics into a reader-facing research note.

A new phase requires a separate explicit scope.
